## 📋 How It Works

The program uses **regular expressions** to check:

* Minimum length (`>= 8`)
* Presence of uppercase letters `[A-Z]`
* Presence of lowercase letters `[a-z]`
* At least one digit `[0-9]`
* At least one special character `[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]`

It then assigns a **score** (0–5) and displays:

* 🔴 Weak
* 🟡 Moderate
* ✅ Strong
* ✅ Very Strong
